# ðŸ§­Navigation task
In this exercise, we will create an application with two screens and an action bar.

The application does not do anything special, it just shows how to 
- implement navigation between the screens 
- implement the action bar 
- add an icon to the action bar 
- move data between the screens 
- handles hardware back button presses on Android 
- The action bar is below the status bar.
